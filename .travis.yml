# Ok folks, its 2018 - and we are still debating on entropy =[
# 
# Long story short, i tried multiple times to implement some form
# of random number support within the travis build system with docker
# AKA sudo:false. Unfortunately, despite offical steps that indicate
# otherwise, even with haveged in docker install. It seems that,
# there isnt enough "entropy", further more due to the travis build
# setup. Finally fighting with the custom java options also seem
# to be an uphill beattle.... so yoloz... 
#
# give up and use VM sudo. I do not need enterprise security 
# for my public opensource unit testing anyway.
#
# Btw : it's the auth/hashing/security module that needed entropy
# to test, which should be kinda obvious why
